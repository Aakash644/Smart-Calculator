Hi Aakash here, i just built a calculator which can work in various modes
such as basic, scientific and trigonometric. 

On running the source code, the compiler asks for the mode in which you want to run the calculator.

1. Basic Mode
*This mode involves basic operations such as addition, subtraction,multiplication and division.
*The compiler asks for the operation to be performed and two numbers a and b.
*Using switch case, we have given the result on case by case basis. 
*After the result is declared, compiler again returns to ask in which mode you want to run to 
run the calculator.
*We have used goto function to return to previous operation.

2. Scientific Mode 
*This is the most interesting mode because it includes running different operations 
such as log, natural log, squareroot, square, factorial, remainder,power(x,y), power(ex).

3.Trigonometric Mode 
*This mode involoves calculating all the trigo functions having degrees as input.
*All the funcs such as sin,cos,tan,cosec,sec and cot are covered in this mode.
